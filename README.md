# Intention Repeater Max

Written in C++, this is the successor to the original Intention Repeater, written in Python.

The code, and the Servitor, were created by Anthro Teacher, aka Thomas Sweet.

It repeats your intention up to 20+PHz, to make things happen.

You probably want intention_repeater_max.cpp if you are on Linux,
and intention_repeater_max.exe if you are on Windows.

To compile, g++ is faster (by a little), but I prefer clang++ because it has a cooler name.

Be sure to check out the clang-format utility to format your code to industry standards.

To compile your code: clang++ -O3 -Wall -static ./intention_repeater_max.cpp -o ./intention_repeater_max

Please see the Example .cpp files for the basics of Multiplying Intention in memory, and to a file.

To edit code I recommend Visual Studio Code.

To format the code, and beautify it, I recommend clang-format.

Special thanks to Karteek Sheri for providing the benchmarking and performance enhancement.
